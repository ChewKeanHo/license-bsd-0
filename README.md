# (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's Public Domain License

A public domain level friendly open source license for
[(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo) product licensing
purposes. This license was adopted from the
[Open Source Initiative's BSD Zero Clause License](https://opensource.org/license/0bsd)
as its baseline and applies the following changes:

1. Changed `Software` to `Product` so that the license can be expanded to
   non-software product licensing usage (e.g. graphics, video, etc) without
   needing to spin multiple licenses; AND
2. Added license assignment, ratification, and tenure section to specify when
   and how is the license applied; AND
3. Added version controlled clauses for which version shall be in effect by
   default.

This license was formally known as
`(Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's BSD Zero Clause License` but was later renamed
as such for consistencies purposes.
